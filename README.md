To generate a private key for the Firebase:
- In Firebase Console, go to Project Settings â†’ Service Accounts
- Go to the Firebase Admin SK panel
- Click the "Generate new private key" button
- Download the JSON file
- Rename it to: UIserviceAccountKey.json
- Move the file into project directory, outside of the static and template folders (so in the same place as server.py)

Then rename the .env.example file to .env

And for running the server, make use firebase-admin and dotenv are installed:
- pip install firebase-admin
- pip install dotenv

The server should be able to run with "python server.py" now!
